              Once upon a time there was a little girl that lived in the woods.
              Her name was Valentine. She saw a little cabin in the woods so she
              went inside the little cabin. When she was inside she saw a witch
              that was friendly. She let her inside. After that she said,
              &quot;do you want to make a potion with me?&quot; Valentine tasted
              it and she said, &quot;Yummy!&quot; The witch said, &quot;do you
              want to go play?&quot; and Valentine said, &quot;do you want to
              come to my house?&quot; and the witch said, &quot;sure but is
              there a park there?&quot; So they went to Valentine&apos;s house.
              The end.
